# browser-start-page

Your very own custom broswer start page!

##Installation

Clone this repo and replace the photo in the images directory with whatever you want your background photo to be. Next, replace my name on line 16 on the index.html file with your own. Feel free to add your own tagline to line 18. Head on over to the style.css file to adjust any formatting.

If using Chrome, navigate to settings and under "On startup" click the "Open a specific page or set of pages." option and then click "Set pages" to open the startup pages box. In the "Enter URL" box, enter "file:///Users/your-username/filepath-to-index.html". Then click 'Ok'.

Next, under the "Appearance" section, click the "Show Home button" option and enter "file:///Users/your-username/filepath-to-index.html" into the space provided.

Now, your brand-spanking-new start page will appear whenever you open Chrome!
